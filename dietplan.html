<h1 id="basics" style="color: darkorchid;">Ketogan Diet Basics</h1> <br>

The keto diet as a rule , is very low in carbs , high in fat and moderate in protien. <br>
When following such diet, carbs are typically reduced to 20 to 50 grams per day though there are less strict versions too. <br>
Fats should replace the majority of cut carbs and deliver approximately <u> 75% </u>of total calorie intake. 
Proteins should account for around <u> 10-30%</u> of energy needs, while carbs are usually restricted to <u> 5%.</u> <br>
This carb reduction forces your body to rely on fats for its main energy source instead of glucose — a process known as 
While in ketosis, your body uses ketones — molecules produced in the liver from fats when glucose is limited — as an alternate fuel source. <br>

Though fat is often avoided for its high calorie content, research shows that ketogenic diets are significantly more effective at promoting weight loss than low-fat diets. <br>
keto diets reduce hunger and increase satiety, which can be particularly helpful when trying to lose weight. <br> <br> <br>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
The keto diet is a low carb, high fat diet. It lowers blood sugar and insulin levels and shifts the body’s metabolism away from carbs and toward fat and ketones. <br> <br> <br> <br>

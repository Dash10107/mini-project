         These usually range from ethics to environmental concerns, but they can also stem from a desire to improve health. <br> <br>
        <h3 style="color: red;">Bottom Line</h3>

<h1 id="weightloss" style="color: brown;">Vegan Diet and Weightloss</h1> <br>
Vegans tend to be thinner and have a lower body mass index (BMI) than non-vegans. <br> <br>

This might explain why an increasing number of people turn to vegan diets as a way to lose excess weight. <br> <br>

Part of the weight-related benefits vegans experience may be explained by factors other than diet. These may include healthier lifestyle choices, such as physical activity, and other health-related behaviors. <br>

However, several randomized controlled studies, which control for these external factors, report that vegan diets are more effective for weight loss than the diets they are compared to. <br> <br>

Interestingly, the weight loss advantage persists even when whole-food-based diets are used as control diets. <br>

These include diets recommended by the American Dietetics Association (ADA), the American Heart Association (AHA) and the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). <br>

What’s more, researchers generally report that participants on vegan diets lose more weight than those following calorie-restricted diets, even when they’re allowed to eat until they feel full. <br> <br>

The natural tendency to eat fewer calories on a vegan diet may be caused by a higher dietary fiber intake, which can make you feel fuller. <br> <br> <br> 
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
Vegan Diets are very effective at helping people naturally reduce the amount of calorie intake one person has, resulting in weight loss. <br>

    Health-conscious vegans substitute animal products with plant-based replacements, such as: <br>
<ul>
<li><b>Tofu,tempeh and seitan:</b>These provide a versatile protein-rich alternative to meat, fish, poultry and eggs in many recipes.</li><br>
<li><b>Legumes:</b>Foods such as beans, lentils and peas are excellent sources of many nutrients and beneficial plant compounds. Sprouting, fermenting and proper cooking can increase nutrient absorption.</li><br>
<li><b>Seeds:</b>Especially hemp, chia and flaxseeds, which contain a good amount of protein and beneficial omega-3 fatty acids </li><br>
<li><b>Plant Milk and Yoghurts:</b>These help vegans achieve their recommended dietary calcium intakes. Opt for varieties also fortified with vitamins B12 and D whenever possible.</li><br>
<li><b>Whole Grains And Cerials:</b>These are a great source of complex carbs, fiber, iron, B-vitamins and several minerals. Spelt, teff, amaranth and quinoa are especially high-protein options</li><br>
<li><b>Sprouts and Fermented Plant Food:</b>Ezekiel bread, tempeh, miso, natto, sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi and kombucha often contain probiotics and vitamin K2. Sprouting and fermenting can also help improve mineral absorption.</li><br>
<li><b>Fruits and Veggies:</b>Both are great foods to increase your nutrient intake. Leafy greens such as bok choy, spinach, kale, watercress and mustard greens are particularly high in iron and calcium.</li><br> <br><br>
